<h2><center><font color="white">QUICK YOGA</font></center></h2>
<h3><font color="white"><p>
<ul>
<li>Here's a brand new quick stretching routine that will hopefully become a new enjoyable go-to cool down for you once you have finished some of our more intense HIIT cardio or strength workouts.
<br>
All of the muscles in the body are gently stretched with this yoga infused workout that takes less than five minutes of your day to complete.  
Otherwise, these are five minutes very well spent. Not only are you stretching your muscles after a workout, you're also working to improve your flexibility and joint range of motion.</li>
<li>
You should never feel pain during any of these stretches. Learning to listen to your body is a bit of an art form, so give yourself the time and leniency of learning how to cater to your body's messages. Tension, or mild discomfort during a stretch is a lot different from pain, so be sure to listen to your body in order to be able to walk that fine line of pushing your own boundaries, safely.
</li><br><li>
Workout Structure
<br>
There is no timer in this stretching workout video, instead we move relatively quickly through a wide variety of movements that are great for stretching out the entire body.
<br>
It is called QUICK because it takes only 5 mins of your day and COOL because that is how you feel after this session </li>
<li>How often can I do this workout?
<br>
You can do this routine as often as you like - you can even do it multiple times through, or multiple times in a day. Do make sure that you don't start this routine on completely cold muscles. For example, if you have been sitting at a computer for an extended period of time, you will want to walk around for at least a couple of minutes, just to warm up those muscles a bit.</li></ul></p></font></h3>
